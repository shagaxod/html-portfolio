<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Oleg Kozhevnykov, a marine engineer for the last 10 years. I've had the opportunity to travel extensively around the world, but strangely, I feel like I haven't truly seen anything. It's time for a change. I'm planning to shake things up in my life by diving into something new. </p>
